# watch-app

## Description
This application is coded in Swift, and makes use of HealthKit to post relevant data. Unfortunately none of us own a Huawei Smart watch, and coding an MVP using 
an Apple watch was our only option. However, we realised Apple was very restrictive in terms of posting data and data is only updated once every 10 minutes.
While the application works, we are unable to get it to work in real time using the Apple watch. However, given time and resources, we are confident
that we are able to do real time updates using Huawei healthkit, and may even expand to notifications, in-app fall detection, and blood O2 saturation, which are
features that are unavailable to developers for the Apple watch.
